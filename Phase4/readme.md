# Phase 4 Code instructions

You will need two files, main.cpp and sorts.h

The sorts.h file holds all the function definitions for the sorting algortihms we have implemented. The main.cpp file holds the main function which tests all the algorithms on a random, sorted and reversed list. In the main.cpp, it also holds the measure function which takes a function as an input and run it inside the body. This function tracks the time that it takes for the function to complete running.

## Running this program

Traverse to a desired directory through you terminal. Once you have reached the desired directory run the following command in your terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Evandabest/AlgorithmsProject.git
```

If you have path set up on vscode, you can type the following in the terminal to automatically open the project

```bash
code AlgorithmsProject
```

Or alternatively, you can navigate to your favorite ide to the cloned git repository.

You will want to delete any files that aren't part of the main program (header files and main.cpp) for the first run. This may include a .vscode file, main text file, outDebug file, main.dSYM file, all of which can show up when running the program or using a debugger.

The reason why these files will show up is because as the programmer, you have to tell vs code how to compile the code, which includes what specific complier you use, what debugger is used and the settings specific to the user. Deleting these files will ensure that the code will compile with the settings you have set up for c++ and the way you usually execute c++ code.
